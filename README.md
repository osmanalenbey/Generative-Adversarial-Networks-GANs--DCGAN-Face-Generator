# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Face Generation with DCGAN

This project is an educational walkthrough of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), starting from the intuition behind Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and culminating in the implementation and training of a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate face images.

ðŸ§  The goal is to make GANs more understandable â€” not just through theory, but also through practical implementation and visual examples.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights

- A step-by-step tutorial introducing:
  - Autoencoders (AEs)
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Probabilistic interpretations of generative models
- Hands-on DCGAN implementation in PyTorch
- Visualizations of:
  - Generated samples over training
  - Latent space interpolation
